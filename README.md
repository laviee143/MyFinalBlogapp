Welcome to My Blog App! ðŸŽ‰

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my little blog project! This is a cozy corner where we share stories, tips, and insightsâ€”starting with cool stuff like breaking into product design. Built with love using React and Tailwind CSS, this app is all about showcasing blog posts in a clean, responsive way. Letâ€™s dive in!

Whatâ€™s This All About? ðŸ¤”

This app lets you browse featured blog posts and a grid of recent ones. Weâ€™ve got a slick homepage with a standout featured section and a scrollable list of recent posts. Each post links to a detailed view where you can (well, soon!) edit, save, or deleteâ€”though for now, those buttons are just for show. ðŸ˜„
